# Franz Recipe for Yammer

This is the unofficial [Franz 5](https://meetfranz.com/) recipe for [Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/).

## Notifications

There are three things that can be used to calculate notifications in Yammer:

1. The inbox (envelope) icon. This is ignored currently because I don't find it useful.
2. The notification (bell) icon. This is used to display the number of unread notifications in Franz.
3. The "Click to see X new messages" message is used only when the "Show message badge for all new messages" is enabled.
